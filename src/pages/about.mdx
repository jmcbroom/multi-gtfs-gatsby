## About this site

We're creating a web site which publishes information about the public transit systems in the Detroit-Windsor region for use by current and potential transit users. We utilize schedule data from each regional agency ([DDOT](/ddot), [SMART](/smart), [The Ride](theride)) in a common machine-readable format, the [General Transit Feed Specification](https://gtfs.org/) (GTFS), and augment with real-time API access whenever possible.
